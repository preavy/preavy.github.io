Joel Meyerowitz says in [this slideshow clip](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-21188741), "Photography is brilliant at describing and yet not letting you know".

Then at 5:02 in the clip, he introduces the French expression "Entre chien et loup", "between the dog and wolf", meaning "hour of dusk" or  "between the known and the unknown".

According to [about.com](http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/entre-chien-et-loup.htm), "entre chien et loup" is when it is dark enough not to be able to figure out whether you're looking at a dog or a wolf.

In the slideshow, his comment accompanies a photo of a pool in Floria by the sea, which looks more like it was taken during golden or magic hour.

Now I'm happy at learning a great figure of speech and anxious about the confusion between of magic hour and when it's nearly dark.

[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight) talks about twilight and blue hour.

But [this page](http://www.coolephotography.co.uk/blog/golden-hour-and-blue-hour/) separates between golden hour and blue hour and I think I'll settle for that. And for "entre chien et loup" as corresponding to blue hour: l'heure bleu.
