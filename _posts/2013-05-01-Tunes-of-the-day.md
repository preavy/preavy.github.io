Sometimes you have a good day with music.

This morning I listened to [Gergiev's version](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stravinsky-Rite-Spring-Valery-Gergiev/dp/B00005NIF6/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1367434766&sr=1-1&keywords=gergiev+stravinsky) of the Rite of Spring.

Later on I came across an amazing song by Flipper - [Ever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxaGx2t2VBM) - which I must have heard before, but today it sounded absolutely amazing.

Finally, I'm still working my way through a Harmonia Mundi [box set](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Harmonia-Mundi-50-Years-Milestones/dp/B000VIFM1S/) I bought in 2007. And on CD 27 of 29, there's an amazing piece for piano and cello by Liszt called [La Lugubre Gondola](http://notesfromapianist.wordpress.com/2013/01/15/la-lugubre-gondola/).
