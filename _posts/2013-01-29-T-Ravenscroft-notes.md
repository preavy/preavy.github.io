Listened to the whole of Tom Ravenscroft's programs for the last 2 weeks. Making some notes for myself about them here.

These were the standouts for me on Fri 18 Jan 2013.

    The Black Keys
    I'll Be Your Man
    The Big Come UP, Alive

    Wave Machines
    Ill Fit (Three Trapped Tigers Remix)
    Ill Fit EP, neapolitan

    Serafina Steer
    Night Before Mutiny (French)

    Lomovolokno
    Cutout
    project mooncircle

    Clouds
    Four Hands
    USB Islands, Ramp Recordings

This stood out in the guest mix by Kwes.

    Solange
    Losing You
    Terrible Records

This is particularly good but I cannot find the version that Tom played anywhere online.

    Bomba Est√©reo
    El Alma y El Cuerpo
    Soundway

The opening tracks were all standouts for me on Fri 27 Jan 2013.

    Valerie June
    You Can't Be Told
    Pushin' Against A Stone

    Ducktails
    Planet Phrom
    domino

    Wave Machines
    Ill Fit
    Neapolitan

Good to hear again. And sounding better than ever:

    Babes in Toyland
    Catatonic
    To Mother, Southern Records

This wasn't so bad and didn't really sound like a-ha.

    The Strokes
    One Way Trigger

Haven't heard this in years and sounded absolutely great.

    Sonic Youth
    Kissability

These must be investigated further:

    Moon Duo
    Ich Werde Sehen
    Moon Duo

    A Hawk and a Hacksaw
    Wedding Theme (ukraine)
    you have already gone to the other world, LM Duplication

And this:

    Black Pus
    1000 years
    all of my relations, Thrill jockey
