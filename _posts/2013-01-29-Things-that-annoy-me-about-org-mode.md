Annoying things about navigation and reorganising in org-mode.

- C-c C-j is no better than a standard C-s (isearch).
- When you land somewhere, you seem to have to hit return or when you start typing, you are just appending things to your search string (though this is just an isearch problem).
- Keys to kill/yank subtrees are fiddly.
- I need to work out keys to go up and down the tree and to step into a subtree (this is probably the main issue).

Essentially I want to be about to get around quickly; to clip bits of subtree off and stick them back in somewhere better.

Probably need some new keybindings.

I will revise this post as I find solutions.
