I'm subscribed to the New York Review of Books blog in Google Reader.

Tim Parks writes posts for it. This evening the same post by him appeared in Reader, with 3 progressively softer titles.

- 6:43PM Forced to Speak American
- 7:27PM Americanizing the World
- 7:35PM Learning to Speak American

Funny.

Here's the [article](http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/dec/14/learning-speak-american/) anyway - a good read.
