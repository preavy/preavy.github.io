I followed the [Jekyll Bootstrap instructions](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).

I already had a GitHub account (barely used).

I checked out the basic repository into a folder in my Dropbox. That way I will have a backup of the whole blog and can tinker with it whether in work (Windows) or at home (Mac).

I would like to be able to blog using Emacs.

I've got this initial blog post up from a Windows machine and without installing Ruby on it since the page processing is all done server-side.
